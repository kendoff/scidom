Jentrata is an open source standards based B2B Gateway thats based on the [Hermes](http://community.cecid.hku.hk/index.php/product/h2o/). Our motivations to fork the codebase are twofold. Firstly there are many enhancements we wanted to make to the codebase, and to have a way to share these changes with the wider community. Secondly, we want to help build a community to allow anyone to get involved with the project.
